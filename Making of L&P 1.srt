Disclaimer: What you are about to see is
special "Hideaki Anno" making-of documentary.

00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,000
Bear in mind while watching and please enjoy.

3
00:00:12,829 --> 00:00:15,360
November 12th, 1997. Imagica

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:23,000
A month before the official premiere,
we're at the press presentation.

5
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,540
Love & Pop Documentary
Part 0

6
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:27,540
[Last Scene]

7
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:31,500
A roar of applause filled the room as the
last scene in the Shibuya River played.

8
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:41,550
It's pretty difficult to film with your average camcorder.

9
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:46,630
I'm so glad that I was able to
participate in the creation of this movie.

10
00:00:49,166 --> 00:00:52,330
Anno's Group [Love & Pop] Staff Room
July, 1997 Filming Room

11
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:56,870
Two weeks before the showing,
there was a meeting about the script.

12
00:00:56,870 --> 00:01:01,210
Finally we go to Miyako Island, as a
way to break away from the ordinary.

13
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:04,910
It's a sort of liberating paradise for the girls.

14
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:06,580
At least from an old man's perspective.

15
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:09,850
From a young person's perspective,
they might wonder why.

16
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:14,590
But if they go, they'll understand how
good the sand and the sun feels.

17
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:16,960
We're not delving into that, though.

18
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,490
That's what I want to believe, but people watching...

19
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:24,500
The last scene in the
southern island is proving difficult.

20
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:28,200
I'm worried people will watch and think,
"Why the heck are these schoolgirl trying to

21
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:34,140
liberate themselves." Stop messing around!
They won't see what is being conveyed.

22
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:40,210
I, obviously, don't have real
experience being a high school girl.

23
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:43,280
This is the reality of our problem.

24
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:49,450
Regardless...we have to hurry up and overcome that.

25
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:55,360
I think as long as we don't get
dragged down by it we should be fine.

26
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,400
And so filming began.

27
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:03,240
In an instant, it was almost over.

28
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,242
September, 1997. Okinawa Miyako Island

29
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:08,940
After fighting through filming in Tokyo,

30
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:14,280
We switched out our heavy equipment and
moved to the islands for a final 3 day, 2 night trip.

31
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:22,550
This was all to film the troubling final scene.

32
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:43,710
Before the script was finished, Anno imagined it
would end with the girls in the southern island.

33
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,520
Oh, poor uniform.

34
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,290
But...

35
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,960
Ah, gross!

36
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,970
Ah, so gross!

37
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:25,780
Not only was the last scene shot here,
but the opening montage, as well.

38
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,990
Filming was proceeding as planned.

39
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:41,470
Before filming the last scene,
the staff gathered together.

40
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:48,940
The film would surely turn out beautiful.

41
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:54,050
"I can sense the blessing of the
film" was written in the script.

42
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:58,820
Anno was in high spirits.

43
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:01,450
Oh, scary, scary.

44
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:09,530
The girls were having no
problem enjoying their time.

45
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:15,330
They were very pretty.

46
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:31,650
Even though Love & Pop is a feature film, everything
up to this point was all filmed on a generic camcorder.

47
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:33,050
- Ready?
- Let go.

48
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,190
We're starting!

49
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,760
- Ok!
- Alright.

50
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,290
Ready...

51
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:39,760
Go!

52
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:45,030
The entirety of this last
scene was a tracking shot.

53
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,330
Cut, cut, cut.

54
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,800
Cut!

55
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:51,970
Come back!

56
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:53,443
Get back here!

57
00:04:56,346 --> 00:04:57,447
Come back!

58
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:59,440
Go!

59
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,440
Chisa, what are you doing?!

60
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:05,050
Filming was proceeding as planned.

61
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:13,330
The only thing not on schedule was
me, Sato, the assistant camera man.

62
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:14,190
Got it.

63
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:15,930
You haven't put this in yet?

64
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:16,490
I'm sorry.

65
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:16,960
What?

66
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:21,870
I had just graduated from school, and
didn't have much on-set experience.

67
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:27,110
Being on set is a race against time.

68
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:29,240
Sato, are you ready?

69
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:33,040
Sato! Now is not the time to change the film roll!

70
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,040
Leave it!

71
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:40,250
I wasn't familiar with changing out film,
so it took longer than it should have.

72
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:48,860
The cameraman, Shibanushi, was glaring.

73
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:52,200
Sato! Sato! Now...Now is not
the time to change the film roll!

74
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:55,930
Ding ding

75
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:03,170
In the end, the film we got fell into the sand.

76
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:13,620
Anno said, "No problem. We'll just film tomorrow."

77
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,890
The sunset was very bright.

78
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:27,130
To wrap up the days filming,
we had a BBQ party that night.

79
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:32,500
Unable to show left side of screen.

80
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:35,040
Director Anno was in a very good mood.

81
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:49,290
He cast off his cool demeanor just like that.

82
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:56,460
Dawn of the 2nd day, 4 a.m.

83
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:00,000
We started with a scene alongside the sunrise.

84
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,840
It was a very energizing shot.

85
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:13,980
Underwater filming was also going well.

86
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,590
Everything was proceeding as planned.

87
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:34,300
But, I messed up again.

88
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:36,900
Sato!

89
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:42,710
Sato! Sato! Now...Now is not
the time to change the film roll!

90
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:52,220
I dropped the film into the ocean.

91
00:07:53,420 --> 00:08:00,460
Because of that, the actress playing Hiromi got
depressed and we couldn't continue filming.

92
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,100
Everything was my fault.

93
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:13,140
This had been our last day to film the sunset.

94
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:19,180
I thought I would go and apologize to the girls.

95
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:23,950
However, they were dead tired.

96
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:29,320
How many do you want?

97
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:36,460
Hiromi's actress was especially worn out.

98
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:40,770
Did you hear what we're doing after dinner?

99
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:41,670
What?

100
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:42,830
Karaoke.

101
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:44,830
I knew that.

102
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,170
There's also an arcade.

103
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,270
I knew that!

104
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,310
An arcade?

105
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,540
All we can do is enjoy ourselves now, right?

106
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:54,710
If you're gonna have fun you gotta go to the arcade.

107
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:56,050
Yeah let's just have fun.

108
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:01,020
You can come and not sing if you want.

109
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:03,250
...karaoke...

110
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,870
After dinner, Anno and Nanri were having a conversation.

111
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:21,110
There's a feeling that they don't want to be saved.

112
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:31,750
But if we show it like they're
some kind of 70s pop idols,

113
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:37,360
I feel like some guys will
understand, so it'll work out.

114
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:42,830
If we have to change the ending, then we have
to change the ending. That's all there is to it.

115
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:49,070
Honestly, I think we should go home.

116
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:56,640
This song, "Happy" is a happy song for everyone all over the world!

117
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:58,080
All over the world.

118
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,080
No matter where you are, there's love!

119
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:05,880
Kind of like, why are you giving it to me?

120
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:13,730
But you know, I think when you
saw Hiromi having fun in the ocean,

121
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:19,530
when you saw that live, you thought,
"Wait, I don't actually want this."

122
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:22,130
Ok, but listen, that's what acting is.

123
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:23,840
Not lowering your standards.

124
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:27,610
I feel like you won't be able to hold out.

125
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:29,970
That's fine.

126
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:33,580
It's more natural to not be able to hold out.

127
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:35,310
Like, "Ahhh, I can't do this anymore."

128
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:39,680
Breaking because of that is fine.

129
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:46,760
If the problem stems from you,
then you have to break down eventually.

130
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:54,970
But it's something that was broken from the
outside, so I'm not sure how to make it work.

131
00:10:57,370 --> 00:11:02,840
You think, "I'll break this." Then it escapes and suddenly, "Oh!"

132
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:05,240
It's broken by someone else.

133
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:13,320
You have to take the broken bits
and quickly fix what you can.

134
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:15,190
Do this, this breaks.

135
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:25,060
How are the girls doing?

136
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,560
Did they fall asleep?

137
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,970
Let them sleep if they want.

138
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:29,600
Who cares?

139
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:32,340
I mean...

140
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:39,180
Should we... No, we don't need to bother them.

141
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:49,750
Oh yeah, are we going to invite them to karaoke?

142
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:50,520
Nope.

143
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:53,960
Is it broken?

144
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,300
They're panicking.

145
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,600
Probably just a cold.

146
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:05,600
No, no, no. I've been told I'm a gloomy person.

147
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:12,610
By the way, even though he's always on my
case, Shibanushi is actually a good person.

148
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:20,050
They told me to act happier so they gave me a sweater—a red sweater,

149
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:21,850
and told me to get it together.

150
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:22,959
I bet it's cause you were poor.

150
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:31,900
And so it was decided we would re-film the last scene the next day.

151
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:41,140
There was also the idea of ending with
the girls in swimsuits in the Shibuya river.

152
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:47,350
The river...

153
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:47,980
What?

154
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:54,590
We aren't getting the expressions we want
at the beach, so our plan is falling through.

155
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:59,420
What about the girls going down Shibuya
river in swimsuits. That's pretty cool.

156
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:04,660
It's cool, I'm not doubting that. If that's how
the script was from the beginning it would be fine.

157
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:10,230
It would be difficult for
people to grasp what's going on.

158
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:16,340
We can send them off, but the problem starts there.

159
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:34,160
Anno caught a brief glimpse of Kirari's underwear.

160
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:37,830
We only have one shot at this.

161
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,730
We're going in the water like this?

162
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:42,570
Of course!

163
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:47,140
It was our last day and the everyone
on set was wracked with nerves.

164
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:56,310
No laughing.

165
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:00,750
The girls were also taking this seriously.

166
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:05,760
If we failed this time, we might as well die.

167
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:10,030
My nerves were also at their peak.

168
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:13,060
Ready...start.

169
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:18,270
I don't remember what happened after this.

170
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:47,270
Before I knew it, I was running
away with the film we had just shot.

171
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,640
Why did I take the film and run?

172
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,440
I also have no idea.

173
00:14:56,040 --> 00:15:00,850
All I knew was the feeling of the tape
swaying and how beautifully blue the sky was.

174
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:10,520
That is how I ruined all of the
film taken in the southern islands.

175
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,460
We were done with location shooting.

176
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:23,230
The clouds were crying.

177
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:28,540
All of this was extra film so
I decided to put it to good use.

178
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:32,910
I put them together and handed
them over as a documentary.

179
00:15:36,452 --> 00:15:42,692
Love & Pop
Part 0

180
00:15:44,126 --> 00:15:50,533
Last Scene

181
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:58,607
In collaboration with all the Love & Pop staff.

182
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:16,610
A roar of applause filled the room as the
last scene in the Shibuya River played.

183
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:22,720
I'm going to try my absolute best
to become a great filmmaker.

184
00:17:22,892 --> 00:17:23,692
The end.
