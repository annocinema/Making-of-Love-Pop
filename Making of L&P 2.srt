1
00:00:03,687 --> 00:00:05,500
Shibuya, August 1997

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:18,460
I woke up this morning believing we'd be stealthily
filming Love & Pop in the corner of Shibuya.

3
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:21,900
Yet, for some reason, we ended up out in the open.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,040
It's like, have they matured or not?

5
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:37,980
We would be filming the climax scene between
Asano Tadanobu's Captain EO and Hiromi.

6
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:46,090
There are a lot of people that would get excited,
but I think he would want to protect the weak.

7
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:47,560
Yeah, he's that kind of guy.

8
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,560
Understood.

9
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:55,900
Location shooting was proceeding as planned.

10
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:12,080
At that time Company Matsuo fled our location and went somewhere.

11
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,930
Matsuo got fed up with
filming and headed to Shinjuku.

12
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:30,130
[AV Director Hirano Katsuyuki]

13
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,070
We're off.

14
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:32,900
See you!

15
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:33,640
I'll do my best.

16
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,370
What's your name?

17
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:35,970
I'm Matanashi Tomoko.

18
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:44,380
Dressed as they are, these two are going
to have sex while traveling to Hokkaido.

19
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:49,150
Matsuo, a man of leisure, embarking with
just himself as director, and his actress.

20
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:54,030
Yes, Matsuo's main profession is an AV director.

21
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:56,260
Not only that, but a point of view director.

22
00:01:58,068 --> 00:01:59,068
Gotanda, July 1997

23
00:01:59,102 --> 00:02:05,940
The audition for Love & Pop took place on this day.

24
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:10,610
Filming for the documentary also started on this day.

25
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:20,490
Despite there only being 3 weeks until
the start of filming, the staff was in a tizzy.

26
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:28,290
I'm still not entirely sure why Anno
chose Love & Pop of all things to adapt.

27
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:40,510
Technically speaking, he'd been saying
he wanted it to be like a fake documentary.

28
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:44,880
And he thought that Love & Pop would
be good for a documentary format.

29
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:52,980
Asking for everything to be filmed with a
camcorder is like groping around in the dark.

30
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,790
This is very Anno.

31
00:02:54,790 --> 00:03:00,560
I decided to ask Higuchi, who understood
how Anno ticked, about his thoughts.

32
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,200
Do you remember the
feeling of digital camera film?

33
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,000
Oh, uh yes.

34
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,800
For Evangelion, well, the ending was shot with a 16mm,

35
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:15,840
but Anno originally bought the VX digital
camera to film a "making of" video.

36
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:20,850
During production, he just kept running
around by himself filming everything.

37
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:22,780
Filming things left and right.

38
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:30,090
Ever since then, his interest in
digital cameras kept growing.

39
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,600
I heard that, but the way we're
filming feels more like a drama.

40
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:49,210
In the beginning, he has a tendency to be really gung-ho about it.

41
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:52,540
We don't need any weird shaking.

42
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:57,250
Wouldn't it be better to station it in a corner?

43
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:06,200
Anno's the kind of guy to say mid-production that he knew how everything would turn out from the beginning.

44
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:07,060
Really, now?

45
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:07,660
Yeah.

46
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:10,760
Wonder why that is...

47
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:16,900
Undecided on whether it
was a documentary or a drama,

48
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:21,710
the auditions were essentially a job to find a Hiromi they envisioned.

49
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:28,910
Having these girls butter up a bunch of old men with cameras to get a role

50
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:32,350
was like compensation was dating taking place right in front of us.

51
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:36,050
I want you to film Anno breaking down.

52
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:40,890
That was the only request for
this making-of documentary.

53
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:45,760
Maybe he broke down after working
on Eva? Following his own characters.

54
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,630
Oh, that's why.

55
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:56,440
Keeping in mind of the original
approach to filming a fake documentary...

56
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:00,480
with a digital camera for
TV Tokyo's late night spot,

57
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:04,620
we proceeded with production as normal.

58
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:10,890
Filming Love & Pop as a
documentary stemmed from this idea.

59
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,760
With that idea as its roots,
the camera took its first shots.

60
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,670
Is it a drama?
Is it a documentary?

61
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:24,740
Everyone waited for the answer.

62
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:27,870
We're out of time!

63
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:36,580
Thinking we might have to abandon everything mid-production,

64
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:41,090
we were left confused by Anno's thought process.

65
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:46,262
Love & Pop Special Showing

66
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:49,690
The lead role went to Miwa Asumi.

67
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:50,930
What do I do?

68
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,740
I've never been in a drama. This is my first time.

69
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,070
It's just...

70
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:00,740
extreme levels of nervous.

71
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:06,510
Love & Pop was gradually turning towards
the normal movie production system.

72
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:11,450
Before we started filming I decided to ask Anno about his thoughts on this.

73
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:12,280
What I want to see?

74
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:17,160
I guess I want to figure that out as I film.

75
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:22,830
It's pretty vague. I don't have
a clear idea of what I want yet.

76
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:26,030
Proposal wise...

77
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,630
I'm just not sure.

78
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,070
It's like, uh...

79
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:42,180
Like an ever-flowing rush of water.

80
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:51,760
This time it's the amount of water between
me and the 4 girls. It's never ending.

81
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,500
I have to put a lot of
effort into bridging that gap,

82
00:06:56,030 --> 00:07:00,470
but I wonder what would happen if I
filmed with the gap still in place?

83
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:02,500
It's fun to bounce the ideas around.

84
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:10,440
And so, filming of Love & Pop started.

85
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:16,180
It was the beginning of a very
long month and a half of filming.

86
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:23,490
The filming proceeded according to the
script as a drama and not a documentary.

87
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:27,890
We retook the same shot
over and over and over again.

88
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:30,330
Sorry, sorry. We're moving locations.

89
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:36,400
Matsuo was surprised with the amount of
cuts since he usually works with sex scenes.

90
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:38,970
After 15 takes we're finally done.

91
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:43,610
Please, no more takes.

92
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:46,810
Let's just hurry up and finish.

93
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,880
This film is taking so long...

94
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:55,550
Why is it that Matsuo, the AV director, is on set now, anyways?

95
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:58,420
Before production started, producer Nanri said:

96
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:04,100
"Instead of focusing on a making of
video, focus on a documentary of Anno."

97
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:09,670
Matsuo misunderstood thinking,
"I must see this task to the end!"

98
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:12,440
The beginning of
that misunderstanding.

99
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,740
Matsuo's partner in crime, AV director Baksheesh Yamashita, said:

100
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:20,510
"Megu is a cutie~"

101
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:24,550
The only part Matsuo
enjoyed was getting food.

102
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:28,690
Filming was proceeding.

103
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:34,430
Eventually, the documentary
started taking shape.

104
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:42,100
Despite being one to usually speak his
mind, Anno is quietly on his best behavior.

105
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:45,200
Will he ever break?

106
00:08:50,780 --> 00:09:01,050
The only interesting part was that Anno never
eats meat or fish, so meals usually look like this.

107
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:14,970
With this being the most interesting thing,
the documentary filming fell stagnant.

108
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:22,170
By the way, my name is Torihada Minoru.

109
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:26,610
A fruit-loving Japanese Communist Party member.

110
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:34,250
While working from 8am to the next day's 8am
in the bread factory, I helped to film this movie.

111
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:37,320
But everything I filmed was cut.

112
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:48,370
Filming moved to a love hotel.

113
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,300
Apparently, the plan is to film through the night.

114
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:02,150
"I paid for that girl" happens over there.

115
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:10,420
It's a love hotel, yet everyone decided to
continue production instead of watch porn.

116
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:17,300
Both the staff and actors silently focused on their job.

117
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:22,400
No one had any interest in the vending
machine outside selling vibrators.

118
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:29,140
Everyone was concentrating all their
efforts towards working on the project.

119
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:33,710
They even spent the night
there so not to waste time.

120
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:40,550
Ok, scene 185, cut J, track 1, camera 4.

121
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:43,050
Camera 3.

122
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:45,960
Are you hungry?

123
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:47,190
No.

124
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:51,760
A whole night working with a
high schooler at a love hotel.

125
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:56,300
I wonder how many guys would bust from that?

126
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,740
Unfortunately, this is the reality of it.

127
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:03,210
Let's try one more time.

128
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:04,980
Alright, one more time.

129
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,250
They're pretty used to their lines but...

130
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:17,090
They decided to change up their attitude toward
the girls, and focus on filming in the morning.

131
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:22,460
We'll finish what needs to get
done. It's just a minor set back.

132
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:28,130
If they come, then it's fine, but we can't ask them.

133
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:35,770
Captain EO, fundamentally doesn't understand people.

134
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:36,440
Ok.

135
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:41,480
From the start, he never saw a
necessity to get along with others.

136
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:44,120
Like, it's fine this way.

137
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:44,720
Ok.

138
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:49,050
But he has another side to him.

139
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,360
He begins to blame himself.

140
00:11:57,530 --> 00:12:01,230
The only one who can talk
him through it is himself.

141
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:05,140
If he thinks he can't do it,
then it becomes a mental block.

142
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:09,940
He has an image in his head and she doesn't fit that image.

143
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:12,340
I think his mother is to blame.

144
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:17,010
It just feels like that.

145
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:25,160
If your mother does something when you're that
sad and crying, then you start to lose yourself.

146
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:28,390
He put revenge against women second.

147
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:32,560
He takes a different approach
when dealing with society.

148
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:39,270
By taking revenge on other women, he is getting
what he really wants: revenge on his mother.

149
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,710
That's how his "relationships" progress.

150
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:44,810
It's awful.

151
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:49,250
It's not really normal to
talk with the director on set.

152
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:53,150
But even then, he's the one
doing most of the talking.

153
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:55,550
I don't have to say a lot.

154
00:12:56,020 --> 00:13:06,560
Before the filming started, there was free time
and I really think I should have talked some more.

155
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:09,000
Alright, wait.

156
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:09,800
Move forward.

157
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:16,710
Scene 189, cut I, track 1,

158
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:29,420
Ok, scene 189, cut J, track 1.

159
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:34,730
Scene 189, cut J, track 2.

160
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:46,940
Even the staff was unable to mask the fatigue that the hard filming schedule hurdle was setting.

161
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,210
People were dropping
like flies one after the other.

162
00:13:56,550 --> 00:14:00,650
Regardless, filming continued in the morning.

163
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:10,860
By the way, the request of "I want you to
film Anno breaking down" was by this man.

164
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:05,950
Since things weren't very thrilling on
set, the two documentary guys took off.

165
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:10,550
Filming. Ready, start.

166
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:15,930
What are you going to ask god for?

167
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,760
- And cut.
- Alright cut.

168
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:24,870
We are just following customers' orders
and thus are innocent under the law.

169
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:33,340
Um, do you think you can go
back in front of Mitsukoshi?

170
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:38,920
Yamashita decided to hear some real stories
from his acquaintance from a sex chat line.

171
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:49,660
The first time I did it was my first year of high school.

172
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:51,230
With my friends.

173
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:59,470
We waited in Ikebukuro for a guy to
ask us, and one did really quickly.

174
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:02,370
So we went to karaoke together first.

175
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:08,710
When my friend masturbated, she earned 30,000 yen.

176
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:11,780
I didn't do much, so I only got 20,000 yen.

177
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:21,530
My friends and boyfriend know so I just
tell them when I'm heading off to work.

178
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:26,400
When I first did it, I thought, "Oh my god this is bad."

179
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:28,600
But I've gotten used to it.

180
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:35,410
I didn't know what I'd do if my
boyfriend or parents found out.

181
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:38,040
My friend has this crazy amazing guy.

182
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:48,950
He paid 70,000 yen and then ran away
while she was taking a shower in the love hotel.

183
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:52,960
I've never had a bad experience
and I've never heard of one.

184
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,960
So do you have sex?

185
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:56,530
Yeah.

186
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,960
What's going on in your head during that time.

187
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:00,730
I just kind of think.

188
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,730
About what?

189
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:03,830
Money.

190
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:08,670
It's a rather boring story, but at least
there was something juicy to her story.

191
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:14,780
Matsuo was meeting with a woman in Takadanobaba.

192
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:17,180
What?

193
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:17,650
Self-defense?

194
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:19,580
Self-defense.

195
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:24,090
How old are you?

196
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:25,490
I'm 28.

197
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:26,920
28? You don't look it.

198
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:30,030
Oh, was...I not supposed to say?

199
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:30,630
It's ok.

200
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:31,290
Sorry.

201
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:31,900
No problem here.

202
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:33,960
I'm 22.

203
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:41,770
They decided to take the
interview to the bathroom.

204
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:42,410
We talk...

205
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:47,310
This is how his usual workday goes, so of course
he would complain about filming normal movies.

206
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:49,110
Do you know any anime?

207
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:54,890
I don't watch too much anime anymore,
but I really liked it when I was little.

208
00:17:56,120 --> 00:18:00,720
Even when I got older I liked stuff like
Slam Dunk. I watched it every week.

209
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:02,330
Have you seen Evangelion?

210
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:05,830
Eva... No I haven't.

211
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:07,830
Do you know who made it?

212
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:10,170
No idea...

213
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:19,580
As far as anime directors go, I only know,
like, Miyazaki Hayao and Oshii Mamoru.

214
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:20,910
I really like Oshii Mamoru.

215
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:30,200
Your name?

216
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,520
Honda Karen.

217
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:39,600
Back on set, filming was finally picking up.

218
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:46,100
Midway, I want you to ask who Mizuaki is.

219
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:50,070
Underwear.

220
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:51,340
Undress down to underwear.

221
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:01,920
Under her underwear she'll have a singlet.

222
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,260
She's not wearing underwear.

223
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:05,560
Not wearing them?

224
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:11,330
Nanri had taken command of production
and things were progressing smoothly.

225
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:12,130
We won't film it.

226
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:20,370
We'll only show her underwear around her
ankle. Then there'll be the skirt and underwear...

227
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:22,210
Yeah that's fine.

228
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:24,210
- It's fine?
- Yeah, yeah.

229
00:19:25,047 --> 00:19:27,950
It was time for the punishment scene in the bathroom.

230
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,450
Miwa is a bit nervous.

231
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:42,290
Did you practice how you were
going to choreograph this?

232
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:44,700
I did with Nanri.

233
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:51,900
I had it explained to me by Nanri and my manager and was able to ask questions.

234
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:56,010
Basically, I have to trust Nanri.

235
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,010
Just waiting now.

236
00:19:58,010 --> 00:19:58,840
And the director?

237
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:01,980
He said as long as I trust Nanri it's all good.

238
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:11,220
He said it's all good, so I guess I'll believe him.

239
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,670
For this next scene...

240
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,910
When you two are facing each other like this.

241
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:41,550
Anno has once again taken
interest in Asano's acting.

242
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:46,720
Lift up by her head and bring her towards you.

243
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,530
Bring her close and finish?

244
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:50,490
Kind of like, "You, come here."

245
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:52,060
Bring her over here.

246
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:54,230
Will you be fine for this scene?

247
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:55,670
You can go till the end?

248
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:57,170
All the way until the end.

249
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:04,240
If she doesn't go down, force the helmet down.

250
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:04,880
Understood.

251
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,310
She has that padding on the back of her.

252
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:14,650
Let's get out of here.

253
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:16,220
- Ok, ok.
- Leaving.

254
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,290
Here we go!

255
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:22,260
Ready

256
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:23,390
Start!

257
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:56,190
With such a short schedule, it's not guaranteed that everyone will end up friends.

258
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:59,930
Miscommunications can happen,
which is a theme I hit on a lot.

259
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:09,270
Acting tough or going with the flow is seen as the right thing to do.

260
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:14,380
You either have the ability to do it or don't.

261
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:16,350
What kind of person is Anno?

262
00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:22,850
He's a very interesting and odd person.

263
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,560
In the beginning he didn't
give that much support.

264
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:29,530
He's still like that. I don't know what he's thinking.

265
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:50,250
Are you ok?

266
00:22:58,490 --> 00:22:59,260
Do you want to leave?

267
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:05,300
Go to the bathroom, practice,
and then we'll wing the rest.

268
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:08,130
If that doesn't work...

269
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:11,030
You'll look naked, but the important parts will be covered up.

270
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:14,870
Got it?

271
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:17,310
Awesome, next.

272
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:19,180
Thank you!

273
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:20,110
Thank you.

274
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:21,310
Thank you.

275
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:28,020
2 days, roughly 36 hours of shooting, wrap up.

276
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:39,900
They overcame one hurdle,
but a long road still lay ahead.

277
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:48,370
While the hard schedule slowly wore them
down, their reassurance in the project went up.

278
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:54,950
It wasn't pressure of a short schedule, it was
being able to see the light at the end of the tunnel.

279
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,680
That's the kind of expression they showed.

280
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:09,390
One month later, all filming completed
and post production was about to begin.

281
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,940
What will you do about the ring?

282
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:23,170
I don't want to give it up, but haven't the nerve.

283
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:31,750
Miwa was able to muster up her
spunk to perform her role as intended.

284
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:40,320
Anno's Love & Pop was completed.

285
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:46,130
The documentary was unable
to capture its intended footage.

286
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:51,340
We had to face these facts of all the wasted time

287
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:55,440
and went on with our presentation.

288
00:25:14,029 --> 00:25:15,998
Anno Hideaki (New Director)

289
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:49,798
Love & Pop Documentary

290
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:50,966
Final Part

291
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:52,960
Bad Summer

292
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:00,390
Dammit!
